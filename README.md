# Inkwell 
Inkwell was made as a final project for Dev Bootcamp, a programming course, over a one week period in July of 2013. It was built by a team of four: Matt Barackman, Uzma Rahman, Nicholas Kirchner, and Phil Mispagel. It is not yet a functional business (so you can't purchase anything), but it is a good demonstration of everything we learned about web development. We may, yet, turn it into a business so stay tuned.

## Live Site:

## Concept:
Inkwell makes it easy to get birthday cards out on time. It is an intelligent birthday card store that allows you to store events like birthdays or anniversaries on the site, than purchase cards for them in advance. Once purchased, users can get on with their lives. Shortly before each event the unwritten birthday card will arrive at their door, with just enough time to handwrite a nice note and mail it to their loved one.


## Notable Technologies Used:
1. Facebook Graph API (authentication/friends/birthdays)
2. Google API (authentication)
3. Etsy API (card listings)
4. Stripe API (payments)
6. Amazon S3 / Paperclip (image storage)
5. Foundation (front-end)
6. HAML/SASS (first-time working with HAML)
